# ENSO Impact on Canadian Wildfires

## By: Garrick Hague

### Introduction:

In this study, the primary objective was to investigate the correlation between Canadian wildfires and ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation). The analysis involved acquiring a shapefile from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System, containing data on wildfires spanning from 1919 to 2020. Specific columns such as incident date, location, and fire size were selected for further examination to maintain focus.

Additionally, data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) was obtained, providing information on the ENSO phase and associated years. By merging this ENSO dataset with the fire data, a comprehensive dataframe was created for analysis and comparison.

### Guiding Question:

To what extent do El Niño and La Niña events in the Nino 3.4 region contribute to the frequency and intensity of Canadian wildfires?

### Hypothesis:

During the El Niño phase, the Earth experiences exceptionally high temperatures, leading to more favorable environmental conditions for fires. Consequently, an increase in both the frequency and size of fires is expected.

# Conclusion

In the realm of Canadian wildfires, the influence of ENSO phases emerges as a complex phenomenon. This analysis delved into the interplay between ENSO phases and the frequency, intensity, and location of wildfires, revealing noteworthy patterns and insights.

- The investigation underscored the significance of ENSO phases in shaping the burned area within Canada. El Niño consistently exhibited the highest average total area burned per year, indicating a strong association between El Niño and amplified wildfire activity.

- La Niña years experienced a faster growth rate in burned area compared to El Niño years, emphasizing the nuanced dynamics at play.

- Provincial impacts further enriched the analysis, showcasing variation in the most impactful phases for different provinces. For example, Alberta's susceptibility to La Niña-induced fires contrasted with the broader trend of El Niño's impact.

- The Northwest Territory and Saskatchewan consistently experienced larger burned areas during El Niño years, hinting at region-specific amplification of the fire's impact.

- While the correlation between ENSO phases and fire events was less pronounced, certain regions stood out by registering fewer fire events but of significantly larger scale, further deepening the understanding of their unique susceptibility.

Ultimately, this analysis contributes valuable insights to wildfire management and climate impact assessment. As our understanding of these connections deepens, stakeholders can better prepare for and mitigate the potential consequences of changing climatic conditions.
